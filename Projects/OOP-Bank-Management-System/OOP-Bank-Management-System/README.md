\# 🏦 Advanced Bank Management System (C++ / OOP)



\## 📌 Project Overview

Developed by \*\*Maher Sawsak\*\*, this is a professional-grade Banking Management System built with \*\*C++\*\*. The project emphasizes a highly modular architecture, utilizing \*\*45 distinct files\*\* to implement a strict \*\*Separation of Concerns\*\* between the core business logic and the user interface.



\## 🚀 Key Features

\* \*\*Modular Design:\*\* Structured with \*\*45 headers and classes\*\* to ensure high maintainability and code clarity.

\* \*\*Secure User Management:\*\* A robust system for managing user profiles and specific access permissions.

\* \*\*Comprehensive Client Operations:\*\* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for bank clients.

\* \*\*Financial Transaction Engine:\*\* Reliable handling of deposits, withdrawals, and account-to-account transfers.

\* \*\*Currency Exchange Module:\*\* An integrated calculator for currency conversion with manageable exchange rates.

\* \*\*Transaction Logging:\*\* Automated recording of every financial movement for audit and history tracking.



\## 🔐 Security \& Architecture

\* \*\*Data Encryption:\*\* A custom security layer that \*\*encrypts user passwords\*\* before they are saved to files. The data is only \*\*decrypted during runtime\*\* for authorized internal verification, ensuring sensitive information is never stored in plain text.

\* \*\*OOP Principles:\*\* Deep integration of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism to create reusable and scalable code.

\* \*\*File Persistence:\*\* Optimized data management using a flat-file database system across all 45 modules.
